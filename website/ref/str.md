@module str

# Introduction

The `str:` module provides string manipulation functions.

Function usages are given in the same format as in the reference doc for the
[builtin module](builtin.html).

The builtin module also contains some string utilities, such as
[string comparison commands](builtin.html#str-cmp) and [`printf`]().
